The Crusaders defeated the Blues live at Eden Park on April 25. The answer, 3028, suggested that from an offensive perspective the Crusaders won. Sevu Reece, Kyle Preston and Chay Fihaki all had six tries each, while Taha Kemara also added some off the tee. The Blues did not get on the scoreboard until two tries to Dalton Papali'i and Finlay Christie. The Crusaders were able to hide their labor, however, because their technique was more efficient. The Crusaders made more runs, gained more meters, made more clean breaks, beat more defenders and made more stops than the Blues. In a sense, they prevailed.
At Eden Park, the Crusaders beat the Blues 42–19 on April 1, 2025. There were many attempts on goal, some exquisite set pieces and well-taken kicks. The Crusaders got off to a perfect start with Kyle Preston, Sevu Reece and Tom Christie all grabbing strong plays in the opening five minutes of play. The Crusaders were bigger and more powerful than the Blues could possibly be. In the end, the Crusaders were the team that dominated the entire game.
On 19 March 2025, the Crusaders made the trip to Eden Park and dominated the Blues, winning 41–19. The Crusaders were more adventurous and played risk-free while defending, which saw both sides cross the try line in the game. The Blues were unable to match the attacking movement demanded by the likes of Williams, Havili and indeed Fihaki. While the Blues opened the scoring, they weren't able to hold onto that lead.
The Historical Invader & The Rival:
Blues VS Crusaders Across the four-decades plus since Super Rugby started, the Blues and Crusaders have met. In the 42 years since the inception of Super Rugby, the Crusaders have won 32 games and the Blues have won 12, with one game tied. As the Super Rugby confidence ebbs and wanes throughout the season, the Crusaders' record speaks for itself with 17 wins from their last 18 games.
Intense games, great postseason runs and a little “bad blood” — often mixed with a healthy dose of mutual respect — have been hallmarks of this long-running rivalry. The Crusaders on tax day claimed their 11th title in the Plunket Shield by beating the Blues, though not as convincingly as in the 2022 Super Rugby final at Eden Park. Suddenly the Blues were able to put an end to their long winning streak.
Blues VS Crusaders The head-to-head battles between Beauden Barrett and Richie Mo’unga have turned match results on their heads and everybody is watching the ball. These competitors are in the thick of the meetings that are happening.
2025 Team Performance and Statistics:
The Crusaders outscored their opponent in recent games (1048 to 982)and charted more clean breaks (66 to 41) and faced more tacklers and defenders (215 to 162).
With the start of the first full season in a four-year cycle, Rob Penney and his coaching staff are doing a stellar job keeping their club performing week on week.
In conclusion:
Blues VS Crusaders By the time 1885 meets matchsome 2025, they find that they once again have nowhere left to go but forwards 1885 versus 1885 has had every extra hand since its last meeting up to when 1885 will follow for me, put simply. The Super Rugby Pacific championship has been emotionally draining, strategically layered, and physically isolating. While the Crusaders have indeed been bloodier and gutsier historically, as well as in recent times, the Blues remain a gritty opposition who could spoil the party
