Blues VS Crusaders had proved to be a difficult and historic one-off event‚ÄÇwhen Super Rugby Pacific 2025 came around. Both teams have shown what they are capable of in recent games and will fight to the‚ÄÇend.
Recent match info shows the client‚ÄÇis current until Oct 2023.
The Crusaders defeated the Blues live at Eden Park on‚ÄÇApril 25. The answer, 3028, suggested that from an offensive‚ÄÇperspective the Crusaders won. Sevu Reece, Kyle Preston and Chay Fihaki all had six tries each, while Taha Kemara also added some off the‚ÄÇtee. The Blues did not get on the‚ÄÇscoreboard until two tries to Dalton Papali'i and Finlay Christie. The Crusaders were able‚ÄÇto hide their labor, however, because their technique was more efficient. The Crusaders made more runs, gained more meters, made more clean breaks, beat more defenders and made more‚ÄÇstops than the Blues. In a sense, they prevailed.
At Eden Park, the Crusaders beat the Blues 42‚Äì19 on April‚ÄÇ1, 2025. There were many attempts on goal, some‚ÄÇexquisite set pieces and well-taken kicks. The Crusaders got off to a perfect start with Kyle Preston, Sevu Reece and Tom Christie all‚ÄÇgrabbing strong plays in the opening five minutes of play. The Crusaders were bigger and‚ÄÇmore powerful than the Blues could possibly be. In the‚ÄÇend, the Crusaders were the team that dominated the entire game.
On 19 March 2025, the Crusaders made the trip to Eden Park and dominated the Blues, winning‚ÄÇ41‚Äì19. The Crusaders were more adventurous and played risk-free‚ÄÇwhile defending, which saw both sides cross the try line in the game. The Blues were‚ÄÇunable to match the attacking movement demanded by the likes of Williams, Havili and indeed Fihaki. While the‚ÄÇBlues opened the scoring, they weren't able to hold onto that lead.
The‚ÄÇHistorical Invader & The Rival:
Blues VS Crusaders Across the four-decades plus since Super Rugby started, the Blues and‚ÄÇCrusaders have met. In the 42 years since the inception of Super Rugby, the Crusaders have won 32 games and‚ÄÇthe Blues have won 12, with one game tied. As the Super‚ÄÇRugby confidence ebbs and wanes throughout the season, the Crusaders' record speaks for itself with 17 wins from their last 18 games.
Intense games, great postseason‚ÄÇruns and a little ‚Äúbad blood‚Äù ‚Äî often mixed with a healthy dose of mutual respect ‚Äî have been hallmarks of this long-running rivalry. The Crusaders on tax day claimed their 11th title in the Plunket Shield by beating the Blues, though not as convincingly as‚ÄÇin the 2022 Super Rugby final at Eden Park. Suddenly the Blues were able to put an‚ÄÇend to their long winning streak.
Blues VS Crusaders The head-to-head battles between Beauden Barrett and Richie Mo‚Äôunga‚ÄÇhave turned match results on their heads and everybody is watching the ball. These‚ÄÇcompetitors are in the thick of the meetings that are happening.
2025‚ÄÇTeam Performance and Statistics:
The Crusaders outscored their opponent in recent games (1048 to 982)and charted‚ÄÇmore clean breaks (66 to 41) and faced more tacklers and defenders (215 to 162).
With the start‚ÄÇof the first full season in a four-year cycle, Rob Penney and his coaching staff are doing a stellar job keeping their club performing week on week.
In conclusion:
Blues VS Crusaders By the time 1885 meets matchsome 2025, they find that they once again have nowhere left‚ÄÇto go but forwards 1885 versus 1885 has had every extra hand since its last meeting up to when 1885 will follow for me, put simply. The Super Rugby Pacific championship has been emotionally draining, strategically layered, and‚ÄÇphysically isolating. While the Crusaders have indeed been bloodier and gutsier historically, as well as in‚ÄÇrecent times, the Blues remain a gritty opposition who could spoil the party
